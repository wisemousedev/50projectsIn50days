          The <b>Russian Blue Cat</b> (Russian: Русская
          голубая кошка, romanized: Russkaya golubaya
          koshka), commonly referred to as just Russian
          Blue, is a cat breed that comes in colors varying
          from a light shimmering silver to a darker, slate
          grey. Their short, dense coat, which stands out
          from the body, has been the hallmark of the
          Russian breed for more than a century.

          The Russian Blue is a naturally occurring breed
          that may have originated in the port of
          Arkhangelsk in Russia.[1] They are also sometimes
          called Archangel Blues.[2] It is believed that
          sailors took Russian Blues from the Archangel
          Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the
          1860s.[1] The first recorded appearance outside of
          Russia was in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in
          England as the Archangel Cat. The Russian Blue
          competed in a class including all other blue cats
          until 1912, when it was given its own class. The
          breed was developed mainly in England and
          Scandinavia until after World War II. Right after
          the war, a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to
          cross breeding with the Siamese. Although Russian
          Blues were in the United States before the war, it
          was not until the post-war period that American
          breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is
          seen in the United States today. American breeders
          combined the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian
          and British Russian Blues. The Siamese traits have
          now largely been bred out. The short hair and
          slate-gray/blue color is often seen in mixed-breed
          cats, which can affect breeders and showers due to
          mislabeling a cat as a Russian Blue.[3] Russian
          Blues are plush short-haired, shimmering pale
          blue-gray cats with emerald green eyes. Guard
          hairs are distinctly silver-tipped giving the cat
          a silvery sheen or lustrous appearance. They have
          been used on a limited basis to create other
          breeds such as the Havana Brown or alter existing
          breeds such as the Nebelung. They are being used
          in Italy as a way to make Oriental Shorthairs
          healthier and more robust called RUS4OSH in
          FIFe.[4] Russian Whites and Russian Blacks were
          created from crosses with domestic white cats
          which were allegedly imported from Russia. The
          first line was developed by Frances McLeod
          (Arctic) in the United Kingdom during the 1960s
          and the second line produced by Dick and Mavis
          Jones (Myemgay) in Australia in the 1970s.[5] By
          the late 1970s, the Russian White and Russian
          Black colors were accepted by cat fanciers in
          Australia as well as in South Africa and now also
          in the United Kingdom as Russian cats (in
          different classes). However, the Cat Fanciers'
          Association and FIFe does not recognize any
          variation of the Russian Blue.
